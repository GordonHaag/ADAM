3/13/15- Beginning of project

The project began today. 


Library Articles Used:

- Multimeter #2- Fluke 115 (3201 0020 38354)
- Lighted Power Block (320101 00020 4063)
- Wire Stripper #4 (32101 0020 3826)

Camera Board- 
The camera board works after being plugged into the 


Footpedal-
The footpedal has 3 wires coming out of it- red, white, and black.

When the pedal is not depressed, the red and black are connected

When the pedal is depressed, the red and white are connected

The RasPi will have to sense when the pedal is depressed. A circuit with the red connected to VCC and white to a digital GPIO pin with a pulldown resistor to GND should work.
-----------------

Implementation:

Pin 1 (3.3V source) is connected to red wire of footpedal. Pin 11 (GPIO0) is connected to white wire of footpedal. This node is also connected to ground with a 47K ohm resistor.
The circuit is tested with src/GPIOdev and functions, a 0 is produced when the pedal is not pressed, a 1 when it is.
